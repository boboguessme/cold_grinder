Version 0.3 - 02 Oct 2012
=========================

Server
------
	* Added a Fuzzer tab to allow users to view statistics (bar charts) about the fuzzers that have been run in the system. You can also drill down in to individual fuzzers to view what targets they are generating crashes on. Added bar chart support via jqPlot.
	* Added a Settings tab. Moved the user account management features from the System tab into this new Settings tab.
	
Node
----
	* Add in initial work for automated testcase reduction via .\node\reduction.rb
	* Added IE10 support (As seen in Windows 8 Consumer Preview) (grinder\node\browser\internetexplorer.rb).
	* Added a --fuzzer parameter to grinder.rb. When bringing up a node you can now specify a single fuzzer to load instead of loading all the fuzzers in the nodes fuzzer directory. Usefull for testing a specific fuzzer (e.g. >ruby grinder.rb --fuzzer=DOMBlaster2000 FF)
	* Added a --help and --version parameter to grinder.rb and testcase.rb.
	* grinder_logger.dll is now thread safe and can handle log messages of an arbitrary size.
	* Changed the server.rb 301 reditect to a 307 temporary redirect.
	* Many small bug fixes!
	
Version 0.2 - 08 Feb 2012
=========================

Wiki
----
	* Added a step by step guide for installing a Grinder Node (https://github.com/stephenfewer/grinder/wiki/Installing-a-Grinder-Node).

Server
------
	* Users can create e-mail alerts for when new unique crashes are generated or when new crashes have been pre verified as interesting/exploitable (upcoming feature).

Node
----
	* Added initial Safari support (grinder\node\browser\safari.rb).
	* When generating crash information, include the modules version and description in the processes module list.
	* Added 301 redirect support to grinder\node\core\server.rb to catch edge cases where a fuzzer ends up trying a bogus request. Now gets redirected back to the fuzzer.
	* Allow browser specific fuzzers via sub directories (IE/CM/FF/OP/SF) in the \grinder\node\fuzzers\ folder.
	* Refactored the javascript portion of the logging out to grinder\node\data\logging.js so it can be updated without effecting existing fuzzers. Updated grinder\node\core\server.rb and grinder\node\fuzzers\SimpleExample.html to use this.
	* Check for grinder_logger.dll in system32/syswow64 and copy if not there, then fail the system test if the copy fails.
	* Bugfix for saving a log file when a concurrancy issue prevents the temporary log file from being accessed or deleated.
	* Removed the $webstats_update_minutes option from config.rb as it can lead to an inconsistency with the Grinder Server.
